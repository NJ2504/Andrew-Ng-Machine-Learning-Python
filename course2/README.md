This folder consists of course 2 of Machine Learning taught by Andrew Ng using Python. This course talks about the biological inspiration of
neurons and how the idea is extended in the creation of Neural Networks. The course starts off with the definitions of what is a neuron and a layer
and what is an activation function. The course further talks about the notations used, Forward propagation and Backpropagation 
and the implementation of a Neural Network using Tensorflow. The next part of the course focusses on model evaluation techniques such as splitting the dataset and explores the concepts of Bias and Vairance. Finally the course teaches algorithms such as Decision Trees and ensemble techniques like Random Forest.
